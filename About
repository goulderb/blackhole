Project name: Blackhole
Version: 1.0-ARCH1
Developer/maintainer: predatorfreak

Requirements: A Bourne-compatible shell, GNU coreutils and iptables.

About: Blackhole is a fork of predatorwall, focusing heavily
on utilising iptables and modular code, to allow easy extension
and modification. It inherits most of the filtering rules from
predatorwall but changes the code layout massively. Another notable
thing about Blackhole is that it inherits installer/upgrader from
predatorwall, albeit in a modified form.

Features:
Clean design and development model
Modular code and clean layout.
Flexible configuration system.
TCP state flag inspection.
TCP flood protection.
Spoofing protection.
Optional dropped packet logging.
