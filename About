Project name: Blackhole
Version: 1.1-ARCH
Developer/maintainer: predatorfreak

Requirements: Bash and iptables.

About: Blackhole is a fork of predatorwall, focusing on heavily
utilising iptables and modular code, to allow easy extension
and modification. It inherits most of the filtering rules from
predatorwall but changes the general code massively. It sacrifices
BSD support for improved code and design, along with more extensive
features such as more flexible port opening.

Features:
Clean design and development model.
Modular code and clean layout.
Flexible configuration system.
TCP state flag inspection.
TCP flood limiting.
Flexible port opening provided by input/output-allow.
Optional dropped packet logging.
