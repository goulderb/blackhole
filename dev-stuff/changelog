Version: 1.0

Minor clean up work in upgrader/installer.
First official release.

Version 1.0-ARCH4
Changes:
Let's skip documentation until 1.5/2.0, so we can get this thing published.

function of it.
Remove the modules documentation, it wasn't very good.

Add some documentation.
Stop using includes/* in upgrader/installer, it's not clean.
Update the todolist, hopefully I can get to 1.0 in a month or so.

Fix up a number of problems with the initial commited code.
Improve upgrader/installer.
