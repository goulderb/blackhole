Version: 1.1-ARCH Commit 3
Changes:
Fix up some problems with rule effectiveness (filter shit before accept
instead of after, which causes rules to loose effectiveness as only unaccepted
packets will be filtered not accepted ones, this change should be put into
effect in predatorwall).
Fix ip-block typo and update installer/upgrader for it.

Version: 1.1-ARCH Commit 2
Changes:
Don't use state past the initial state match, it's pointless and unproductive.

Version: 1.1-ARCH Commit 1
Changes:
Includes a quick-implementation ipblock module, needs further expansion to support per-port blocking.
Reenable dropping of fragmented packets.
Change flood-limiting.bmod's NAME header.

Version: 1.0
Changes:
Minor clean up work in upgrader/installer.
First official release.

Version 1.0-ARCH4
Changes:
Let's skip documentation until 1.5/2.0, so we can get this thing published.
Completely kill passive-ftp, it's been obsoleted by output/input-allow.
Rename "state" too "extended options", extended options better explains the
function of it.
Remove the modules documentation, it wasn't very good.

Version: 1.0-ARCH3
Changes:
Add some documentation.
Stop using includes/* in upgrader/installer, it's not clean.
Update the todolist, hopefully I can get to 1.0 in a month or so.

Version: 1.0-ARCH2
Changes:
Fix up a number of problems with the initial commited code.
Improve upgrader/installer.
Add state support to input/output-allow.
Clean up passive-ftp.

Version: 1.0-ARCH1

First bunch of code commited to the Arch mirror.
