Version: 2.0-GIT
Changes:
- Fix issues where rules do not use $DROP, using DROP instead.
- Fix some syntax errors in bruteforce-defeat.bmod (patch will be published
  for 1.1)
- Remove syn-flood prevention, this might return as a per-port module.
- A new module, ipblock-nfqueue, is included that sets up the required
	iptables rules for moblock/iplist.
- The ipblock-blackhole module replaces ip-block, being more configurable and
	effective.
- Add in iptables fail checking, by aliasing iptables to failcheck iptables,
  failcheck is a function which runs all arguments passed to it as one command
	and then checks for common failure exit codes.
- Various micro optimisations and cleanups.
- Use tabs, not spaces.

Version: 1.1
Changes:
- Massive change involving rule order and effectiveness, the order of the
  MODULES array now MATTERS. The order of the array determines the order of
  rules. For example, loading tcp-flag-inspection then flood-limiting causes
  packets to be run through flag inspection first, then flood limiting. It
  should be noted that core should ALWAYS be last, otherwise other rules will
  override it and that would be really ugly. This is an unfortunate price to
  pay, but this makes a properly ordered MODULES array provide much better
  effectiveness.
- New module, bruteforce-defeat, that uses ipt_recent to defeat SSH
  bruteforcing, noted future plans on extending it for other ports/protocols.
- Make input/output-allow use their own tables now.
- A lot of clean up work.
- Merge previous changelog information (1.0-ARCH*) to save space.
- Slightly changed changelog layout, prefix sections with - and indent entire
  sections. Fix old entry errors.
- Better failure handling in load_module, if we can't load because of a
  dependency resolving error we print "[DEPERROR]" after the module and skip,
  if the module doesn't exist we print "[MODERROR]" after the module and skip.
- Implement a "generic" install/upgrade target, this does everything that was
  done in the Fedora/Gentoo/Mandriva options, as they all duplicated each other.
- Fix up some problems with rule effectiveness (filter stuff before accept
  instead of after, which causes rules to loose effectiveness as only accepted
  packets will be filtered and not unaccepted ones, this change should be put into
  effect in predatorwall).
- Don't use state past the initial state match, it's pointless and unproductive.
- New module, ip-block, provides the ability to block specific IP's.
- Reenable dropping of fragmented packets.
- Change flood-limiting.bmod's NAME header.

Version: 1.0
Changes:
- Minor clean up work in upgrader/installer.
- First official release.
- Let's skip documentation until 1.5/2.0, so we can get this thing published.
- Completely kill passive-ftp, it's been obsoleted by output/input-allow.
- Rename "state" too "extended options", extended options better explains the
- function of it.
- Remove the modules documentation, it wasn't very good.
- Add some documentation.
- Stop using includes/* in upgrader/installer, it's not clean.
- Fix up a number of problems with the initial commited code.
- Improve upgrader/installer.
- Add state support to input/output-allow.
