Version: 1.1
Changes:
- Some assorted cleanup work.
- Make input/output-allow use their own tables now.
- Minor cleanup work here and there.
- Merge previous changelog information (1.0-ARCH*) to save space.
- Slightly changed changelog layout, prefix sections with - and indent entire
  sections. Fix old entry errors.
- Better failure handling in load_module, if we can't load because of a
  dependency resolving error we print "[DEPERROR]" after the module and skip,
  if the module doesn't exist we print "[MODERROR]" after the module and skip.
- Implement a "generic" install/upgrade target, this does everything that was
  done in the Fedora/Gentoo/Mandriva options, as they all duplicated each other.
- Fix up some problems with rule effectiveness (filter stuff before accept
  instead of after, which causes rules to loose effectiveness as only accepted
  packets will be filtered and not unaccepted ones, this change should be put into
  effect in predatorwall).
- Fix ip-block typo and update installer/upgrader for it.
- Don't use state past the initial state match, it's pointless and unproductive.
- Includes a quick-implementation ipblock module, needs further expansion to support per-port blocking.
- Reenable dropping of fragmented packets.
- Change flood-limiting.bmod's NAME header.

Version: 1.0
Changes:
- Minor clean up work in upgrader/installer.
- First official release.
- Let's skip documentation until 1.5/2.0, so we can get this thing published.
- Completely kill passive-ftp, it's been obsoleted by output/input-allow.
- Rename "state" too "extended options", extended options better explains the
- function of it.
- Remove the modules documentation, it wasn't very good.
- Add some documentation.
- Stop using includes/* in upgrader/installer, it's not clean.
- Fix up a number of problems with the initial commited code.
