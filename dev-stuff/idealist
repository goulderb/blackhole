Add modules for handling specialised tasks:
Brute-force defeater, using ipt_recent and rigid limiting, combine with a whitelist.

Automatic iptables failchecking:
Use a function that gathers all the arguments passed to it and sends them to
iptables, then call failcheck to make sure iptables didn't die.
(We'll see if this is required, it would add code for just doing pretty exits)
