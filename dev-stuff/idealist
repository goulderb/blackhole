Add modules for handling specialised tasks:
ip-block module, too block specified IP addresses.
Come up with other useful module ideas.

Automatic iptables failchecking:
Use a function that gathers all the arguments passed to it and sends them to
iptables, then call failcheck to make sure iptables didn't die.
(We'll see if this is required, it would add code for just doing pretty exits)
