Add modules for handling specialised tasks:
Specialised port opening can be done using the input/output-allow modules.
Possibly handle management of iptables logs?

Automatic iptables failchecking:
Use a function that gathers all the arguments passed to it and send them to
iptables, then call failcheck to make sure iptables didn't die.
